      "You can buy real estate ERC20 tokens, which represent ownership interest of an actual property. After completing your identity verification , you may deposit EL tokens into your wallet and swap for real estate tokens.

If the property is sold, you will also receive rewards from sales proceeds with discounted rates (the longer you hold, the more rewards)",

      "An Ethereum wallet is a tool for managing your Ethereum or ERC20 tokens. It can be created through various service providers such as Metamask (https://metamask.io/) or MyEtherWallet (https://www.myetherwallet.com/). Please refer to each service description on how to create your own wallet.",
      "Elysia is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace and only provides information related to real estate tokens and the tools for swapping it with other tokens. The actual transaction is conducted between wallets and Elysia does not have any authority or custody over your funds.
