      "You can buy real estate ERC20 tokens, which represent ownership interest of an actual property. After completing your identity verification , you may deposit EL tokens into your wallet and swap for real estate tokens. You will receive daily rewards based on how many real estate tokens you own proportional to its monthly rental income. If the property is sold, you will also receive rewards from sales proceeds with discounted rates (the longer you hold, the more rewards)",
      "You may receive additional EL tokens depending on how much and how many real estate tokens you own. The rewards are calculated from the moment you hold the represented token. The number of tokens may be differ each real estate token, so make sure you check the property information.",
      "On the main page, you can check the types of tokens you currently own, or select and enter the tokens you wish to swap. You may swap real estate tokens with EL tokens by pressing the'Swap' button on the page.",
      "You can check the reason for rejection of KYC in the notification message. Please check the reason and request KYC again.",
      "Since the distribution of rewards is based on real assets, we need to make sure counterparts do not transact for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist funding. All personal information will be encrypted and stored by our KYC provider, Argos solutions.",
      "An Ethereum wallet is a tool for managing your Ethereum or ERC20 tokens. It can be created through various service providers such as Metamask (https://metamask.io/) or MyEtherWallet (https://www.myetherwallet.com/). Please refer to each service description on how to create your own wallet.",
      "Elysia is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace and only provides information related to real estate tokens and the tools for swapping it with other tokens. The actual transaction is conducted between wallets and Elysia does not have any authority or custody over your funds. In this regard, we require you to register your own personal wallet address to perform swaps."
