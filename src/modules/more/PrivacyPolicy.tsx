9.5  Why we use cookies. When you access our websites, application and/or services, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your computer or other device. These technologies help us better understand user behavior and inform us about which parts of the websites, applications and/or services people have visited.


9.6  We use cookies for the purposes described in Clause 4 above.


9.7  Categories of cookies we use. We may use the following categories of cookies:


9.7.1  Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary because they enable you to move around our websites and applications, and use certain features of our services. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas. Without these cookies, some services cannot be provided.

These cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you have seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you last saw it. This information may be used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads. These cookies are anonymous – they store information about the content you are browsing, but not about who you are.
